# FMScreen

## Description

A screening server for entity/ person name against denial lists such as BIS Entity List.

## Features

- Fuzzy term matching using Levenshtein distance.
- Divided query terms matching with single list term.
- Fuzzy query matching respecting term similarity, term order, and term importance of IDF.
- Perfect matching mode disabling fuzzy matchings for reducing false positives in some cases.
- Accepting Latin characters, Chinese characters, Katakana characters, and others.
- Canonicalaization of traditioanal and simplified Chinese characters, and others.<br>
This makes matching insensitive to character simplification.
- Canonicalaization of spelling variants of legal entity types such as "Limitd" and "Ltd.".<br>
This makes matching insensitive to spelling variants of legal entity types.
- White queries for avoiding screening your company itself and consequent false positives.
- Results cache for time performance.
- Solo query accepted by the web server for interactive UIs.
- Bulk queries accepted and processed parallel by the web server for batch applicaions.
- Text normalizing API to get the global identifier of a neme.
- Aggregates/ spreads matched names to itmes of denial lists.
- And others.

## Usage

### Fetch the public denial lists (optional)

```text
dart bin/fetchdl.dart 
```

This fetches lists from [US Government's Consolidated Screening List](https://www.trade.gov/consolidated-screening-list "Consolidated Screening List") and [Japanese METI Foreign End Users List](https://www.meti.go.jp/policy/anpo/law05.html#user-list "安全保障貿易管理**Export Control*関係法令：申請、相談に関する通達").

### Compile the web server

```text
dart compile exe -v bin/server.dart -o bin/server
```

**Note**: The JIT mode doesn't work for some reasons. See dart-lang/sdk#50082.

### Start the web server

```text
bin/server
```

### Screen a name with verbose option

```console
$ dart bin/screen.dart -v '888'

### Get the body with a internal item ID

```console
$ dart bin/screen.dart -b CONS3524@1670117118000
source: Nonproliferation Sanctions (ISN) - State Department
programs:
  - E.O. 13382
name: Defense Industries Organization
federal_register_notice: "Vol. 72, No. 63, 04/03/07"
start_date: 2007-03-30
source_list_url: https://www.state.gov/key-topics-bureau-of-international-security-and-nonproliferation/nonproliferation-sanctions/
alt_names:
  - Defence Industries Organisation
  - DIO
  - Saseman Sanaje Defa
  - Sazemane Sanaye Def
  - "Sasadja"
source_information_url: https://www.state.gov/key-topics-bureau-of-international-security-and-nonproliferation/nonproliferation-sanctions/
id: 44048d5165eca98c9556e3e64bed51a0213cc6c94d8ce9caae3d280d
country: IR
```

### Run the sample batch

```console
$ ls batch
queries.csv
$ dart bin/batchwb.dart -i batch/queries.csv
 ...
$ ls batch
queries.csv
queries_results.csv
```

### Reflesh the server

```text
dart bin/screen.dart --restart
```

This makes the server reload the database, reread the configurations and the settings, and purge the result chache.
This is useful when the denial lists are updated or the configurations/ settings are modified.

### Get normalized text as the global identifier of a name

```console
$ dart bin/screen.dart -n 'abc'
ABC
```

Note that matched names from this server are normalized in the same way.
